Slang Standard Library Reference
=============

Welcome to the Slang Standard Library Reference.

Please select a topic from the table of contents to see the detailed documentation of
system defined types, interfaces, methods and constants that can be used in a Slang
program.

This reference groups the standard library declarations as:
- [Interfaces](./interfaces/index.html): all builtin interfaces usable as generic constraints.
- [Types](./types/index.html): all builtin types and their members, such as `StructuredBuffer`, `Texture2D` and etc.
- [Global Declarations](./global-decls/index.html): all other constants and functions defined in the global scope.

This documentation is still a work-in-progress.
